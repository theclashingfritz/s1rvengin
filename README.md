Sonic the Hedgehog (Mega Drive) Reverse Engineering
===========================================

This is a reverse engineering of Sonic 1 code into C, 
Sonic 1 is not natively made into C and as such there will be differences in the 
C code compared to any disassembly.

On top of this, Some code and structures are cleaned up for convenience sake. 

[Disassembly](https://github.com/cvghivebrain/s1disasm) used for reverse engineering work.
